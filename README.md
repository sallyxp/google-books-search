# Google-Books-Search - a react components project using a MongoDB database
This respository creates a React-based Google Books search app.  React components are created and the book list is accessed via the Google Books API.  Books are searched for by title, and the user can save titles onto a MongoDB database.  The user then has an option to "View" the book, which will take them to the book on Google books or "Delete" a book, which will remove it from the Mongo database.

This project has been created using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.  MERN.
